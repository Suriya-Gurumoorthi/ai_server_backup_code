# Async/Await Fixes for Modular Pipeline

## Problem Identified

The system was storing and processing `<Future ...>` objects instead of their resolved values, causing the transcription and context extraction to fail silently. The logs showed:

```
INFO:__main__:Transcription completed: <Future pending cb=[_chain_future.<locals>._call_check_cancel() at /usr/lib/python3.12/asyncio/futur...
INFO:__main__:Context extracted: <Future pending cb=[_chain_future.<locals>._call_check_cancel() at /usr/lib/python3.12/asyncio/futur...
```

## Root Cause

The functions `ultravox_transcribe` and `extract_key_context` were using `run_in_executor` without `await`, returning `Future` objects instead of actual results.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Function Signatures
- Changed `ultravox_transcribe` from `def` to `async def`
- Changed `extract_key_context` from `def` to `async def`

### 2. Added Proper Awaiting
- **Before**: `result = loop.run_in_executor(...)`
- **After**: `result = await loop.run_in_executor(...)`

### 3. Updated All Function Calls
- `transcript = await ultravox_transcribe(audio_bytes)`
- `context = await extract_key_context(transcript)`
- `user_context = await extract_key_context(sanitized_user_message)`
- `assistant_context = await extract_key_context(sanitized_assistant_response)`

## Functions Modified

### Core Functions
1. **`ultravox_transcribe`** - Now properly async and awaits transcription results
2. **`extract_key_context`** - Now properly async and awaits context extraction results

### Pipeline Functions
3. **`process_audio_pipeline`** - Updated to await transcription
4. **`store_transcript_memory`** - Updated to await context extraction
5. **`store_conversation_memory`** - Updated to await context extraction for both user and assistant messages

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the logs should now show actual transcript and context content instead of `<Future ...>` objects:

```
INFO:__main__:Transcription completed: Hello, this is a test message...
INFO:__main__:Context extracted: User greeting and test message...
```

## Testing

The system should now:
1. Properly transcribe audio input to text
2. Extract meaningful context from transcripts
3. Store relevant context in vector memory
4. Generate appropriate AI responses based on conversation history

## Architecture Flow (Fixed)

```
Audio Input → [await] Transcription → [await] Context Extraction → Memory Storage → Response Generation
```

All async operations now properly await their results, ensuring the pipeline processes actual data instead of Future objects.
