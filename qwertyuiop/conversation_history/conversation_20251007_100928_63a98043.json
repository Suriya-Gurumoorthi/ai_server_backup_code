The recruiter clarified that they had a good time talking, but due to the candidate's response (\"not\") indicating no change, the conversation progressed without a significant exchange.\n\nThe candidate continued to express indifference, stating that their initial message stood unchanged. The recruiter attempted to guide the conversation back on track by asking follow-up questions, but the candidate remained evasive.\n\nThe conversation concluded with both parties agreeing that the candidate's message had already stated their intention, and the recruiter acknowledged the lack of progress while providing some context about the hiring process."
