The Candidate responded incompletely, stating \"you\" instead of their full name. To ensure clarity, Alex asked them to repeat what they wanted to say.\n\nAlex then initiated the conversation, explaining that they use a first-name approach but always ask for the candidate's full name to ensure accuracy. They started the question, asking the candidate to explain their background and career motivations."
