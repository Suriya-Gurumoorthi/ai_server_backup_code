It sounds like LinkedIn played a role in helping you discover our company. Now, let's dive deeper into your qualifications. As a Business Development Manager, you're responsible for finding new clients, building pipelines, and coordinating with existing ones. Can you walk me through your resume and highlight any relevant experience, especially in industries similar to ours?",

Since you mentioned you're interested in improving your career, I want to assure you that Novel Office values professional growth and development. However, I do need to verify a few things to ensure we can continue this conversation effectively.\n\nMay I remind you that our company is based in Texas, USA, and we operate primarily in India and the US? This might help us better understand your location and requirements. Also, I wanted to touch base with the team about your profile, which says you're a recent graduate with some experience in [industry/field]. Would you mind confirming your current employment status and any relevant projects you're involved with?",
