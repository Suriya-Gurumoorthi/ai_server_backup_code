  "summary": "Here's a summary of the interview conversation:\n\nThe conversation began with an unknown candidate (a) expressing their interest in a Business Development Manager role at Novel Office in Bangalore. The recruiter, Alexa, asked general questions about the candidate's background and motivations. However, the candidate responded poorly to several questions, including being unable to pronounce words correctly (\"nn int revw in bwnn\", \"int revw in bwnn\", \"u t n d r a c k t r e s p i c t b e y\").\n\nDespite these issues, Alexa continued to try to engage the candidate and address some of their concerns. However, the candidate provided further confused and unclear responses, such as saying \"A\" instead of \"yes\" to Alexa's question.\n\nFinally, the candidate attempted to correct some of the misunderstandings by responding to specific questions. Unfortunately, they did not successfully explain themselves or provide clear answers."
