As for your commute to Novéla Office in Marathahalli, is there anything specific you're concerned about - such as traffic, public transportation options, or parking availability? And also, what day and time would work best for you for an in-person interview?",

Are you looking to relocate here permanently, or are you considering working remotely or part-time while you adjust to the new location?",

  "summary": "Here's a summary of the interview conversation:\n\nThe candidate (who introduced himself only once) expressed his interest in discussing potential opportunities with Novel Office. The recruiter, Alexa, asked clarifying questions to ensure she understood the candidate's background and location. The candidate responded with a series of non-committal answers, indicating he wasn't entirely familiar with Bengaluru.\n\nAlexa clarified her expectations and offered to provide information about the candidate's previous location, Marathahalli, and the company culture. She also asked the candidate about their expected compensation package for the Business Development Manager role.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Alexa seemed curious and engaged, asking follow-up questions to gather more information. However, the candidate's responses remained brief and lacked concrete details.\n\nUltimately, the conversation ended without a clear decision or offer, as Alexa didn't seem convinced that the candidate met the job requirements or was a good fit for Novel Office."
