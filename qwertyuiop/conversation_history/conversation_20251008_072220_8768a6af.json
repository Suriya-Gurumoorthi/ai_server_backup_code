  "summary": "Summary:\n\n* The candidate spoke to the HR recruiter, Alexa, in an unknown caller ID.\n* Alexa asked the candidate to confirm their identity before proceeding.\n* The candidate replied \"I can't heal you properly\", which may have been an attempt to deflect or avoid direct questioning.\n* Alexa responded by assuming the candidate had said \"hello\" after acknowledging her name, likely making small talk to ensure communication was established.\n* Given the context, it can be inferred that the candidate's response was not genuine or sincere.\n\nOutcome:\nThe conversation did not progress further due to the candidate's uncooperative response."
