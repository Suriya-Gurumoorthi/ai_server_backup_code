  "summary": "Here's a summary of the interview conversation:\n\nAlex, a candidate for a Business Development Manager position at Novel Office, interviewed with Alexa from Novel Office. The initial conversation revealed Alex's lack of knowledge about the company, title, and role, leading to some awkward moments.\n\nAs the conversation progressed, Alex struggled to answer basic questions, including their experience and qualifications. They provided limited information about themselves, making it difficult for Alexa to assess their fit for the role.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Alex became increasingly frustrated and eventually stopped responding. Eventually, Alexa politely ended the call, stating that they would store the recording for future reference.\n\nDespite the rocky start, the conversation remained calm and professional throughout. However, the candidate's inability to provide accurate and relevant information raised concerns about their ability to excel in the role."
