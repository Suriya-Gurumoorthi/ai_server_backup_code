  "summary": "Here's a summary of the interview conversation between the recruiter (Alexa) and the candidate:\n\nThe conversation started with the recruiter confirming the candidate's identity and background. They discussed the position of Business Development Manager at Novel Office in Bangalore, and the recruiter asked the candidate if they were interested in the role. The candidate responded by saying they were interested in science.\n\nEarly in the conversation, the recruiter made a mistake by calling the candidate \"you\", which caused unnecessary further questioning when corrected.\n\nLater, the recruiter asked the candidate about their qualifications and experience, and was surprised when the candidate stated they would accept any offer without negotiation, regardless of salary.\n\nWhen the recruiter tried to discuss the salary range for the Business Development Manager role, the candidate made a comment asking for ₹1 crore per annum, which was clearly unacceptable.\n\nThe conversation took a turn when the recruiter attempted to connect with the candidate again and ended with the recruiter stating that they couldn't engage in a conversation with explicit language.\n\nIn the end, the conversation concluded with the recruiter expressing disappointment in the candidate's responses, especially regarding salary expectations."
