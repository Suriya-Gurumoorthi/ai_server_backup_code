Let's discuss the role and see if it's a good fit for you.\n\n**Candidate**: Yes, go ahead and ask me the questions.\n\n**Interviewer:** You seem to have a lot of experience in business development management. However, the job posting mentioned that we don't require prior experience in our specific industry.\n\n**Candidate**: I have three years of relevant experience.\n\n**Interviewer:** Okay, that's great. Now, let's talk about building relationships with potential clients. Can you give an example of how you approach that?\n\n**Candidate**: I believe you would build these relationships by understanding client needs, identifying pain points, and providing value solutions.\n\n**Interviewer:** Excellent answer. Finally, regarding relocation, are you currently based in Bengaluru or open to relocating to Marathahalli (near my office)?\n\n**Candidate**: Yes, I am currently based in Bengaluru, but I'm willing to consider relocation to Marathahalli for the right opportunity.\n\nThe outcome was promising, as the candidate demonstrated strong experience in business development management and good communication skills.

Overall, a positive interaction."
