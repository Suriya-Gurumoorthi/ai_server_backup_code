  "summary": "Summary:\n\n- The interview was conducted by Alexa, an HR recruiter at Novel Office.\n- A candidate named Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch (likely a placeholder for a full name) introduced themselves as Surya.\n- Surya had 5 years of experience in business development and asked about Novel Office and their job role.\n- When asked about relevant skills and experience, Surya briefly explained their background.\n- Alexa interrupted to ask if Surya had any questions about the company or position.\n\nOutcome:\nSurya seems to be unaware of the role they were interviewing for, and Surya did not show much interest in discussing their qualifications or experiences further."
