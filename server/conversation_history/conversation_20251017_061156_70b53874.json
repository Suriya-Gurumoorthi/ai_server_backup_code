Can you walk me through some of the notable deals or clients you've worked with in the past three years? \n\nAnd just to recap, could you also tell me what average annual combined cost to cover tax payments, national insurance, and other benefits for an employee would look like for this role?

You mentioned earlier that you're familiar with the concept of Serviced Office Space, Coworking, and Real Estate.

  "summary": "**Summary of Interview Conversation**\n\nThe interview conversation with the candidate for the Business Development Manager position at Novel Office consisted of three main parts:\n\n1. **Introduction**: The candidate introduced themselves and discussed their interest in the role.\n2. **Background and Experience**: The recruiter asked the candidate to share their relevant work experience, highlighting three years of experience as a Business Development Manager, which was sufficient but not directly related to the job requirements.\n3. **Revised Question**: After making an error regarding industry experience, the recruiter asked the candidate to expand on their experience, focusing on their understanding of Serviced Office Space, Coworking, and Real Estate, particularly in the Marathahalli area.\n\nDuring the conversation, there were two instances where audio processing errors occurred:\n\n*   One instance where the audio was corrupted due to the presence of multiple audio placeholders (\"Text contains too many audio placeholders\").\n*   Another instance where an unclear tone was picked up during the conversation, but no further discussion was initiated to clear the communication gap."
