  "summary": "This interview conversation was between a candidate named \"Suriya\" (correctly spelled as \"Suriya\") and an HR recruiter named Alexa. The conversation started with Alexa confirming Suriya's name as \"Saviya\". However, it seems there were errors in the audio recording, including placeholder text.\n\nThe primary goal of the call appears to be to assess Suriya's background and suitability for a Business Development Manager role. During the conversation:\n\n* Alexa asked Suriya to briefly describe her background.\n* Suriya provided an incorrect response due to the audio issues.\n* Alexa clarified the purpose of the question and requested more detailed information about Suriya's qualifications and experience.\n* Additional questions were asked, but with the same error in the audio.\n\nUnfortunately, the conversation was disrupted by errors in the audio, making it difficult to accurately summarize the discussion."
