  "summary": "**Summary of Interview Conversation**\n\nThis was an informal recruitment interview between a Recruiter named Alexa and a candidate named Ganesha.\n\nThe initial stages of the interview focused on Ganesha's background, including his educational background (B.Com), lack of direct experience in Business Development, and specific questions about the compensation expectations. The Recruiter attempted to clarify these points, but they seemed to stall briefly due to an audio technical issue.\n\nAfter resolving the technical issue, the Recruiter asked Ganesha to rephrase his initial statement, which he interpreted as wanting to work as a \"medium\" instead of a Business Development Manager. He reassured Ganesa that Novel Office welcomed diversity in hiring practices and valued individual perspectives.\n\nGanesha continued to express interest in becoming a Business Development Manager at Novel Office, but highlighted his lack of direct experience. However, he emphasized his eagerness to learn and grow within the role.\n\nAs the interview progressed, the Recruiter began to outline the requirements and responsibilities of the role, emphasizing the importance of business development skills, strong communication, and problem-solving abilities.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Ganesha provided occasional responses, and the Recruiter probed him gently to gather more information and clarify any concerns.\n\nUltimately, the conversation concluded with the Recruiter expressing enthusiasm for moving forward with the application process after a thorough evaluation of Ganesha's qualifications and experiences."
