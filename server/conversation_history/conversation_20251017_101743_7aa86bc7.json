  "summary": "Here is a summary of the interview conversation:\n\nA candidate applied for a Business Development Manager role at Novel Office in Bengaluru. During the initial call with a recruiter named Alexa, the candidate was asked to confirm their location and express interest in working with Novel Office. However, there was a technical issue that caused the conversation to be interrupted.\n\nThe candidate attempted to continue the conversation, mentioning they were in Bangalore, but accidentally stated multiple locations. Alexa politely clarified the intended location and the candidate responded by saying \"chick chick chick chick\", indicating she thought it was asking for multiple cities rather than specific ones. The conversation continued without further issues."
