The candidate provided some general answers, including their job title and industry experience.\n\nAs the conversation progressed, Alexa asked the candidate specific questions about the role of a Business Development Manager, such as the types of industries they would be working in and any relevant skills or experiences. The candidate responded briefly at first, but eventually became more engaged and asked Alexa some follow-up questions.\n\nHowever, it appears that the candidate cut off the conversation mid-sentence, and Alexa was left waiting without a final answer. Despite this, Alexa continued to engage in a somewhat casual and conversational manner, trying to guide the candidate through the interview process.\n\nOverall, the conversation showed that Alexa is friendly and approachable, but may need to improve her questioning strategy to get more detailed and comprehensive answers from candidates.",
